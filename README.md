# A collection of free GameMaker assets/projects

## Why
GameMaker Marketplace is getting replaced with some prefabs system, so I'm putting these assets here for now.

I will probably not update these since they are free and I'm moving to Godot so I don't have much time for updating them.

Enjoy? ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌

## Table of contents

### Drawing program template
A drawing program template. I don't know why I made this but it looks cool?!

### Health system with hearts
A simple health system. Three of them kind of.

### Physics knockback
A simple example of making knockback using GameMaker's physics system.

### Testing helper - Debug console
A graphical debug console that makes testing easier.

Before it was paid, but I'm not using it anymore, so I'm putting it here too.

### Text Box Maker PRO (for GMS 1.4)
A dialogue system. Previously paid, now free and open source. It's the predecessor of my [Dialogue engine for GameMaker](https://pikku-a.itch.io/dialogue-engine).

### Simple dialog maker (for GMS 1.4)
Another dialogue system. It's the predecessor of the other dialogue system. The grandfather of my [Dialogue engine for GameMaker](https://pikku-a.itch.io/dialogue-engine), you could say.
