# A collection of free GameMaker assets/projects

## Why
GameMaker Marketplace is getting replaced with some prefabs system, so I'm putting these assets here for now.

I will probably not update these since they are free and I'm moving to Godot so I don't have much time for updating them.

Enjoy? ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌

## Table of contents

### Drawing program template
A drawing program template. I don't know why I made this but it looks cool?!

### Health system with hearts
A simple health system. Three of them kind of.

### Physics knockback
A simple example of making knockback using GameMaker's physics system.

### Testing helper - Debug console
A graphical debug console that makes testing easier.

Before it was paid, but I'm not using it anymore, so I'm putting it here too.
